## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Estanislao Claucich and I'm currently a PhD student at the Research Institute for Signals, Systems and Computational Intelligence, also known as [sinc(i)](http://sinc.unl.edu.ar/).  

My research mainly focuses on studying different problems related to fairness in machine learning, from understanding how these scenarios can happen to designing different solutions for them.
